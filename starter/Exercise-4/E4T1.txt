# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

- Restrict SSH access using Session Manager or for specific roles
- Disable SSH password login on the application server instance

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- Apply default server-side encryption on the secret recipe S3 bucket. All new objects are encrypted when they are 
stored in the bucket. Server-side encryption can be done with either Amazon S3-Managed keys (SSE-S3) or Customer Master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
- Implement the principle of least privilege access which would allow access to only the free recipe S3 bucket.
