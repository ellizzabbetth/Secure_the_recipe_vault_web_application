# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Use AWS Systems Manager's Session Manager service in order to access the application and remove ssh access from this instance.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No. The default policy of a gateway endpoint allows access to any request within the VPC to any S3 resource.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No. Enabling default encryption doesn't change the encryption of objects that are already in the bucket. After default encryption is enabled, the encryption applies only to future uploads.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

Applying the original cloud formation templates to this environment would override the configurations made through the AWS management console.
